/**
 * This event is fired whenever a chunk has its ticket level changed via the server's ChunkMap.
 * <p>
 * This event does not fire if the new ticket level is the same as the old level, or if both the
 * new <strong>AND</strong> old ticket levels represent values past the max chunk distance.
 * <p>
 * Due to how vanilla processes ticket level changes this event may be fired "twice" in one tick for the same chunk.
 * The scenario where this happens is when increasing the level from say 31 (ticking) to 32, the way vanilla does it
 * is by first changing it from 31 to 46, and then queuing the update from 46 to 32. However, when going from 32 to 31,
 * vanilla is able to go directly.
 * <p>
 * This event is fired on the {@linkplain MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS main Forge event bus}
 * only on the {@linkplain LogicalSide#SERVER logical server}.
 *
 * @param getLevel the server level containing the chunk
 * @param getChunkPos the long representation of the chunk position the ticket level changed for
 * @param getOldTicketLevel the previous ticket level the chunk had
 * @param getNewTicketLevel the new ticket level the chunk has
 * @param getChunkHolder the chunk that had its ticket level updated, may be null
